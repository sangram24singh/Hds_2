        X
         and 
        Y

        The relationships between integers 
        X
         and 
        Y
         are as follows:
        
        If 
        X
        <
        Y
        , it means that 
        X
         is smaller than 
        Y
        .
        If 
        X
        >
        Y
        , it means that 
        X
         is greater than 
        Y
